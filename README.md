# Kaggle Credit Risk Competition

## Getting Started

 * Install [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) so that your Python life won't be a complete disaster.
 * Set up a kaggle account and [install the `kaggle` command line tool](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).
 * Execute the `download_data.sh` script to download the archive.
 * Unzip the above data file in a parallel folder named `input`. In other words, the input folder will be in the same folder as the credit-risk folder.
 * Execute `run_jupyter.sh` to launch Jupyter.
 * Open the `mbastian.ipynb` to see the baseline model or `Start Here_ A Gentle Introduction.ipynb` for a full rundown.
 * Suggested: Make a notebook under your username in this repo. Feel free to fork, PR, merge, etc.
